However, the interaction lacked depth in terms of needs discovery. ${userName} did not ask further questions to explore the prospect's specific challenges or goals, which would have provided valuable insights for tailoring the presentation. Additionally, there was no detailed information shared about the offerings, leaving the prospect without a clear understanding of the value proposition. The conversation also missed opportunities to build rapport by not engaging with the prospect's introduction or expressing empathy towards their business goals. Overall, the interaction could benefit from more active listening, detailed questioning, and a structured approach to presenting solutions and handling objections.`

However, the demo felt somewhat generic and could have been better tailored to the specific prospect's needs and use case. ${userName} spent considerable time on features but could have connected these more directly to business outcomes and ROI. The session would have benefited from more discovery questions at the beginning to understand the prospect's current challenges and desired outcomes. While some objections were addressed, a more structured approach to objection handling would have been more effective. The session ended without a clear next step, which represents a missed opportunity to advance the sales process.`
